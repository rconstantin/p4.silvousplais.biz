Project 4 for DWA Class: NONAME application with users (subscribers) with signup/login/pwd capability. 
AJAX/JS to be used for client side validation in addition to server side validation for signup/login user input.

Core application idea is to allow users to manage youtube playlists with following enhancements to what vanilla youtube playlists currently offer:
        1 - manually add/delete a video to playlist
        2 - dynamically add videos to history playlist - allow others to subscribe to this
        3 - allow users to subscribe to each others playlist
        4 - if possible, programmatically disable or skip ads (HTML5 automatically takes care of this)
        5 - use youtube player API to control manager video playback (remove YT logo and autohide controls)
        6 - manually clear history
